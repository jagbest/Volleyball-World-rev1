Purpose: 
A web site for volleyball, designed to be a "one stop shop" for players, parents/friends, coaches, referees, etc. 

Features: 
I tried to enhance the site by implementing a responsive design and adding jQuery functionality to create a "spoiler" to attract interest.

Steps on how to view the web site:
1. Double click on the file folder icon.
2. Click on the Index file and it will come up in the viewport.
From there the "Players" button is linked to a "For Players page.
3. The "Players" page contains links to various internet web sites by interest area.
